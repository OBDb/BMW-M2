## Generations

The BMW M2 has gone through two main generations, representing BMW's entry-level M performance car based on the 2 Series platform:

- **First Generation F87 (2016-2021)**: The original M2 launched in 2016 as BMW's entry-level M car, replacing the rare 1M Coupe. Initially powered by a turbocharged 3.0L N55 inline-six producing 365 hp, the first generation was built on the F87 chassis and featured rear-wheel drive configuration. The M2 Competition was introduced in 2018 as a mid-cycle refresh, replacing the standard M2 with the S55 twin-turbocharged engine from the M3/M4, producing 405 hp. The limited-run M2 CS was introduced in 2020 as the final and most hardcore variant, featuring 444 hp and winning the Evo Car of the Year 2020 award.

- **Second Generation G87 (2023-present)**: Introduced in 2023, the second-generation M2 is built on the CLAR platform shared with the G80 M3 and G82 M4. It features a larger wheelbase (2.1 inches longer) and overall dimensions while maintaining the rear-wheel drive philosophy. Powered by the twin-turbocharged 3.0L S58 inline-six engine producing 453 hp initially, it was updated for 2025 with increased power to 473 hp and enhanced torque output. The second generation maintains the availability of both 6-speed manual and 8-speed automatic transmissions, continuing BMW's commitment to enthusiast driving.
