# BMW M2

This repository contains signal set configurations for the BMW M2, organized by model year and version. The files are structured to allow for easy differentiation between model generations and other vehicle parameters, ensuring accurate signal mapping for each version of the BMW M2.

## Generations

The BMW M2 has gone through three main generations, each representing significant evolution in performance and technology:

- **First Generation F87 (2016-2020)**: The original BMW M2 was introduced as a compact high-performance coupe based on the 2 Series platform. It featured a twin-turbocharged 3.0L inline-6 engine (N55) producing 365 hp in the standard model, with the M2 Competition (2018-2020) receiving the more powerful S55 engine from the M3/M4, producing 405 hp. Known for its excellent balance, rear-wheel drive configuration, and pure driving experience, the F87 established the M2 as a spiritual successor to the classic BMW M3 E30.

- **Second Generation G87 (2021-present)**: The current generation M2 represents a complete redesign with significantly more aggressive styling and enhanced performance. It features a twin-turbocharged 3.0L inline-6 engine (S58) producing 453 hp, shared with the larger M3 and M4 models. Key improvements include updated chassis dynamics, modern interior technology, and enhanced aerodynamics while maintaining the rear-wheel drive layout that defines the M2 character.

- **Third Generation (Future)**: While not yet officially announced, BMW typically follows a 6-8 year development cycle for M models, suggesting a next-generation M2 may arrive in the late 2020s with potential electrification and further performance enhancements.
